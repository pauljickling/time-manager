`tm summarize {activity}` creates a summary for a particular activity

`tm summary {activity}` produces activity summary

`tm time {activity}` produces amount of time spent on a particular activity

`tm time {activity} -range={range}` produces amount of time spent on a particular activity within a specified range

`tm list` produces a list of activities
